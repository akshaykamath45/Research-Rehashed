# Predicting the Outcome of League of Legends Games using Machine Learning

**Abstract:**

League of Legends is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game with a large and active player base. Recently, it has become an official sport as an e-sport in the 2022 Asia Games. Analytical skills are becoming increasingly important in the e-sport field, and one way to improve analytical skills is to use machine learning to analyze game data and make predictions about game outcomes.

This research uses a machine learning approach to analyze League of Legends game data and predict the outcome of the game. The dataset used in this research records the first 10 minutes of diamond-ranked games. Several popular machine learning algorithms are applied to the dataset, including:

* AdaBoost
* GradientBoost
* RandomForest
* ExtraTree
* SVM
* Naïve Bayes
* KNN
* LogisticRegression
* DecisionTree

The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using cross-validation, and the algorithms that outperform the others are selected to create a voting classifier. The voting classifier achieves an accuracy of 72.68%.

**Remaining models to implement as code:**

The following machine learning models are still to be implemented:

* RandomForest
* ExtraTree
* SVM
* Naïve Bayes
* KNN
* LogisticRegression
* DecisionTree


**Future work:**

Future work could involve:

* Implementing the remaining machine learning models (like  Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs))
* Ensemble models, such as stacking and blending) and evaluating their performance
* Using a larger dataset that includes more features
* Developing a more sophisticated voting classifier
* Applying the proposed machine learning approach to other games

**Conclusion:**

This research demonstrates the potential of using machine learning to analyze League of Legends game data and predict the outcome of the game. The proposed voting classifier achieves an accuracy of 72.68%, which is promising. Further work is needed to implement and evaluate the remaining machine learning models and develop a more sophisticated voting classifier.
